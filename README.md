# Doe-Anderson Coding Challenge
 ## Overview
 This is the basic coding challenge using JS, html, and CSS. The database is NoSQL on firebase where the app is also deployed. 

 This is a pretty rough go, but somethings that I would like to add, but, did not get to, are the various wiggles in the layout as well as the placement of the error and success messages for the form. I would have also like to do more with the mobile versus large screen view. The CSS is also not as organized as I like it, in the future I would seperate CSS files and keep things a litte more tidy.

[Here is the deployed app](https://doeanderson-dba24.web.app/)

[You can access the db here with permission](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/doeanderson-dba24/database/doeanderson-dba24-default-rtdb/data)

This was a fun activity as it makes you dig down into the DOM and just brush up on some basic JS. I really appreiate all of y'alls time.
